# Security Code Scanner

A Python-based security code scanner that helps identify potential security vulnerabilities in your codebase. This tool performs automated scanning to detect common security issues, hardcoded secrets, and potential vulnerabilities while generating comprehensive HTML reports with solutions.

## 🚀 Features

### Security Checks
- 🔑 Hardcoded secrets and API keys
- 🌐 Insecure protocols (HTTP)
- 💉 SQL injection vulnerabilities
- 🐛 Debug mode configurations
- 🔓 Unsafe CORS settings
- 🖥️ Hardcoded IP addresses
- 🎟️ JWT tokens in code

### Smart Scanning
- 📂 Excludes common build directories (node_modules, .next, etc.)
- 🖼️ Skips binary and asset files
- ❌ Reduces false positives
- 🎯 Intelligent pattern matching

### Detailed Reporting
- 📊 Severity-based classification
- 📍 Precise file and line locations
- 💻 Actual code snippets
- 🛠️ Recommended solutions
- ✅ Best practices guidance

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
